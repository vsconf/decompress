    Ri currently works for The Guardian, creating data stories and interactive content. She specialises in expressing data in novel ways and exposing social injustices; from creating art out of motion captured dance data, to exploring the gaps between men and women around the world. Her indispensable tool of choice is D3.js but is WebGL-curious.

    Tommy is a software engineer (with a much sillier actual title) at Adobe on the PhoneGap team who enjoys talking in the third person, vegan food, beer, attempts at humour, and trying to sound humble through self-deprecation. He has a passion for busting the myths surrounding building native mobile apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Apache Cordova.

    Charlie is a designer, developer, and musician all the way from London, England. He's produced a series of music videos for his band Brightly using all kinds of technology, from WebGL, the Twitter API, live-sourcing GIFs from Giphy, multi-streamed video, webcams, and more. He'll be helping you get started on your own experiments with create-react-app and Three.js.

# Workshop Format

In the morning, they will each inspire you with some of the amazing things that they've built and show you the libraries, tools, and APIs that they used. The idea is that you then choose a project to work on (or maybe you will have even thought of one beforehand!) and throughout the day build something amazing of your own. In addition to the people above, there will be lots of other people around to help you out and provide advice. At the end of the day, we'll all go to a nearby pub to discuss what we learned and built over some drinks. We are hoping that everyone has a great time, learns a bunch, and goes away having made lots of new friends.

# Survey

If you haven't already, we're asking that everyone fill out this very short (2 question) [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeOdQmNC-0l7-2DBne9QcBkTK1AyeSYR_9Av53csM3YPgmUhA/viewform). This is to help us get an idea of how many people will likely be coming to Decompress this year. Given a lot of you will have a Decompress ticket that came with your ticket(s) to CSS/JSConf it's not easy for us to estimate this otherwise.
